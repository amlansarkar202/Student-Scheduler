# Student-Scheduler

The **Student Daily Scheduler** is a C++ command-line tool designed to help students plan their week efficiently. It automatically assigns time blocks to tasks based on their priority, deadline, and preferred study hours — while accounting for existing commitments like classes or meals.

This scheduler improves productivity by organizing your day, managing workload, and ensuring breaks are taken regularly.

## 🚀 Features

✨ Key functionalities of the scheduler include:

- ✅ **Priority-based Task Scheduling**  
  Schedule tasks based on urgency (1–10 priority scale) and deadline (day of the week).

- ⏰ **Time Preference Support**  
  Choose your preferred start and end hours for each task (e.g., only evenings or mornings).

- 🧠 **Smart Task Splitting & Break Management**  
  Tasks are automatically split into 30-minute blocks, with 30-minute breaks added after 90 minutes of continuous work.

- ❌ **Avoids Conflict with Existing Commitments**  
  Preoccupied slots like lectures, meals, or meetings can be entered so scheduling avoids overlaps.

- 💾 **Save & Load Weekly Schedules**  
  You can save your schedule to a file (`schedule.txt`) and load it again later — ideal for reuse.

- 📊 **Daily Summary Generator**  
  View how many minutes you spent being productive, on breaks, and how much free time remains — for each day of the week.
